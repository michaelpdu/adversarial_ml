    strings:
        $a = Queries for the computername
        $b = Uses Windows APIs to generate a cryptographic key
        $c = Tries to locate where the browsers are installed
        $d = Checks amount of memory in system, this can be used to detect virtual machines that have a low amount of memory available
        $e = The executable contains unknown PE section names indicative of a packer (could be a false positive)
        $f = Performs some HTTP requests
        $g = Resolves a suspicious Top Level Domain (TLD)
        $h = Queries the disk size which could be used to detect virtual machine with small fixed size or dynamic allocation
        $i = Steals private information from local Internet browsers
        $j = Looks up the external IP address
        $k = Checks adapter addresses which can be used to detect virtual network interfaces
        $l = The binary likely contains encrypted or compressed data indicative of a packer
        $m = Connects to smtp.mail.ru, possibly for spamming or data exfiltration
        $n = Checks the CPU name from registry, possibly for anti-virtualization
        $o = Harvests credentials from local FTP client softwares
        $p = Harvests information related to installed instant messenger clients
        $q = Collects information about installed applications
        $r = Harvests credentials from local email clients
        $s = Queried details from the computer were then used in a network or crypto API call indicative of command and control communications/preperations
        $t = A process performed obfuscation on information about the computer or sent it to a remote location indicative of CnC Traffic/Preperations.
        $u = Creates known UFR Stealer files, registry keys and/or mutexes
        $v = Connects to an IP address that is no longer responding to requests (legitimate services will remain up-and-running usually)
