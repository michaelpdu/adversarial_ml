    strings:

        $b = Checks amount of memory in system, this can be used to detect virtual machines that have a low amount of memory available
        $c = One or more potentially interesting buffers were extracted, these generally contain injected code, configuration data, etc.
        $d = Connects to a Dynamic DNS Domain
        $e = Allocates read-write-execute memory (usually to unpack itself)

        $j = Deletes its original binary from disk
        $k = Connects to an IP address that is no longer responding to requests (legitimate services will remain up-and-running usually)
