    strings:

        $b = Checks amount of memory in system, this can be used to detect virtual machines that have a low amount of memory available
        $c = One or more potentially interesting buffers were extracted, these generally contain injected code, configuration data, etc.
        $d = Connects to a Dynamic DNS Domain

        $k = Installs itself for autorun at Windows startup
